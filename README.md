# Squaggler

This is a Firefox extension to switch around the beginnings of words (sometimes called a [spoonerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism), though this is more specific), inspired by [this tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/sufficientlylargen/787874584104943616/let-me-check-yeah-i-guess-so).
It's mostly been tested on Wikipedia:

To install, grab the xpi file [here](https://github.com/axolotls73/squaggler/releases/tag/v0.1) and add as a temporary add-on (unless you want to [disable signing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62237202/firefox-add-ons-how-to-install-my-own-local-add-on-extension-permanently-in-f#62256098) and install it permanently for some reason).
To add as a temporary add-on, go to `about:debugging` in your address bar, then click `This Firefox` > `Load Temporary Add-on` and select the xpi file.

This extension may mess up some websites with editable content, so use at your own risk!
